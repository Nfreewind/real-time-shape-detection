#OpenCL installation process

1. Download latest AMD APP SDK

2. Follow the instructions in pdf

After all I need to manually perform the steps:

set PATH to have libOpenCL.so

create /etc/ld.so.conf.d/amdapp_x86_64.conf  

with entries:

/opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/
/opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/sdk


run sudo ldconfig


To compile examples in OpenCl the linker need to know where libOpenCL.so.1 is
so best way is to create a symlink 

sudo ln -s /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/sdk/libOpenCL.so.1 /usr/lib/libOpenCL.so.1
